## Features

Very basic (but thorough) syntax highlighting for various IKEMEN GO code files, for Visual Studio Code.

## Installation
A pre-made, ready to install .vsix file can be found in the [releases section](https://github.com/ikemen-engine/zss_vsc/releases) of this repository. Just open up VS Code, go to the Extensions view, click **Views and More Actions...**, and select **Install from VSIX...**, and select the .vsix file. Alternatively, run `code --install-extension ikemen-highlighting-0.5.0.vsix`.

You can also package your own .vsix file, using the source code: [install vsce by following these instructions,](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension#vsce) then, run `vsce package` in the root of the extension's folder.

When this is fully released, it will (probably) be published in the VS Code Extension Marketplace, making installation and updating as simple as a click of a button.

## Known Issues
- This has not yet undergone rigorous testing, so there might be some things mishighlighted, or things that should be highlighted that aren't.
- There are a number of teneous leaps in logic to try and apply standard programming archetypes to MUGEN/IKEMEN stuff. For example: triggers are highlighted as functions, whereas state controllers are highlighted as classes. Trigger redirects are, for some reason, highlighted as regex (IKEMEN doesn't use regex so this should be fine, probably). The goal of all this is to try and ensure there is a lot of separatation and distinction made between each different type, even if the IKEMEN concepts are only roughly analogous to their respective highlighting rule.
- Because several triggers and state controllers have identical names (and because of certain inherent limitations in the TextMate language grammar system that defines the highlighting rules), picking what category to highlight them as presents a challenge. In general, the only major problem happens with `SprPriority`, which will be only highlighted as a state controller if there is a `{` immediately following it on the same line (in all other cases, it will be highlighted as a trigger).
- As a constantly updating engine, new triggers, state controllers, and others are constantly being added to IKEMEN's lexicon, so this is probably already out of date at time of release.
